# Hi, I'm Alex. ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm passionate about building and managing robust platforms, and for me, Kubernetes and the cloud native world have been key. While my interest in Linux and open source started earlier, it was Kubernetes that really drove me to explore innovative deployment methods. Over the past years (since February 2022), I've been working with Kubernetes clusters, tackling challenges in administration, development, and architecture. I still get a kick out of itâ€”it's like solving a new puzzle every day, and it takes me back to the excitement of setting up my first cluster and issuing that first kubectl command. I rely on tools like Bash, Go, Python, Terraform, and Ansible to get the job done. Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and growth, always seeking new knowledge to deliver even better platform services.
