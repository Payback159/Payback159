### Hi there, my name is Alex ðŸ‘‹

I had an early interest in Linux and open source software in general, but it was Kubernetes and my entry into the cloud native world that sparked my interest in learning the different ways to deploy a platform.  I've been working in Kubernetes cluster administration, development and architecture for ~4 years (12.02.22) and find it as exciting as my first kubectl command on the first cluster I installed myself.

Mainly I use Bash, Golang, Python, Terrafom and Ansible in my daily work.

Since then I'm always on the track to learn new things to be able to provide even better platform services.
