## 🚀 About Me

I'm a dedicated **Platform Engineer** with 3+ years of hands-on experience in Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. My journey began with a curiosity for Linux and open source, but it was Kubernetes that truly ignited my passion for innovative deployment methodologies and scalable infrastructure.

**What drives me:**

- 🔧 Building robust, scalable platforms that enable teams to ship faster
- 🧩 Solving complex infrastructure puzzles (it's like a new challenge every day!)
- 📚 Continuous learning and staying ahead of cloud-native trends
- 🌱 Mentoring others and sharing knowledge within the community
