### Hi there, my name is Alex ðŸ‘‹

I've been working in Kubernetes cluster administration, development and architecture for ~4 years (12.02.22) and find it as exciting as my 1st kubectl command on the 1st cluster I installed myself. For a good year now, I have also been allowed to contribute to an OpenStack landscape as a cloud architect.

Mainly I use Bash, Python, Terrafom and Ansible in my daily work and since a good half year I'm also trying my hand at Golang application development in private.
